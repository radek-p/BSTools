HOWTO make it

To begin one needs the following software ready to work:

- The GNU make program (using another make may require changing the Makefiles).

- The gcc compiler and ar program. Testing the quality of code generated
  by various versions of the compiler was not done.

- The TeX typesetting system (for the documentation); the documentation uses
  the Computer Modern, Concrete Roman and Euler font packages.

- The pstools package (psnup, to format the documentation with two pages
  on one side of a sheet of paper).

- Ghostscript and (for convenience, non-obligatory) Ghostview programs.

- The X Window system (to run the demo programs),
  there are no requirements concerning any details (no particular window
  manager, graphical or other library: OpenGL, Motif, Gnome, KDE,
  Athena widgets etc. are not requred).

A Linux distribution usually has all the above present. What to do in
another system, I do not know, but whoever wants to use it, will find out.


To compile the package, issue (in this directory) the commands

	make mrproper
	make

By default, the GNU gcc compiler, with optimization options turned on,
will be used. Writing 'make debug' instead of 'make' causes using
the -g option, which is useful with the DDD debugger.
Writing 'make icc' causes using the Intel icc compiler
(but it has to be installed).

After the compilation the command

	make clean

leaves the final product (the libraries and demonstration programs),
but it removes the *.o files and PostScript figures, unless they were
considered necessary by me.
